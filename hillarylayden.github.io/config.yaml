    title: "About Me"
    image: "/images/me.png"
    content: |-
      I am a biochemist interested in how transcriptional dysregulation contributes to cancer and other diseases. I use a wide array of molecular biology, genomic, and proteomic techniques to interrogate how particular proteins regulate transcription and contribute to disease pathogenesis. I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Hiebert Lab at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN.

      My thesis research is focused on transcriptional dysregulation in Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma.
